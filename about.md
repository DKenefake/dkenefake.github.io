Howdy! I'm Dustin Kenefake, and I'm a second-year chemical engineering student in the [Pistikopoulos Lab](http://parametric.tamu.edu/) at Texas A&M. My primary research interest involves leveraging optimization for process systems engineering in the space of model predictive control and real-time optimization. In undergrad I worked in the [Krempner Lab](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/chemistry/Faculty/krempner/) studdying new catalytic systems. In my off time, I like cooking and making beer.
