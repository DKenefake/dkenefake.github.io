<p>Howdy! I'm Dustin Kenefake and I'm a second-year chemical engineering PhD student in the <a href = "http://parametric.tamu.edu/"> Pistikopoulos Lab</a> at Texas A&M. My primary research interests are at the intersection of optimization and process systems engineering, specifically in the space of model predictive control and real-time optimization.</p>

<p> Here is an interactive plot that describes the solution to a multiparametric quadratic programming problem in the uncertainty space.</p>
