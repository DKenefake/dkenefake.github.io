  <p>Howdy! I'm Dustin Kenefake and I'm a second-year chemical engineering PhD student in the <a href = "http://parametric.tamu.edu/"> Pistikopoulos Lab</a> at Texas A&M. My primary research interests are at the intersection of optimization and process systems engineering, specifically in the space of model predictive control and real-time optimization. Most of the content of this website is in the blog section. The blog coverse a wide array of topics, including implmenting algorithms, data driven methods, optimization and much more.</p>
  
  <p> Here is a simple plot that describes the solution to a multiparametric quadratic programming problem w.r.t. the uncertainty parameters. A quick dive on this subject can be found <a href="https://dkenefake.github.io/blog/mpp">here</a></p>

  <p> For more information about Multiparametric programming and it's applications <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fceng.2020.620168/full">this paper</a> is a good jumping point.
