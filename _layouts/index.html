<p>Howdy! I'm Dustin Kenefake and I'm a second-year chemical engineering student in the [Pistikopoulos Lab](http://parametric.tamu.edu/) at Texas A&M. My primary research interest involves leveraging optimization for process systems engineering in the space of model predictive control and real time optimization.</p>
