# About
I am Dustin Kenefake, a Post Doc for in the [ProOptiMA group](https://www.mierapetritou.com/research). Formerly, a PhD student in the [Pistikopoulos Group](https://parametric.tamu.edu/), where I focus mainly on algorithms and software for automatic desision making. In undergrad I worked in the [Krempner Lab](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/chemistry/Faculty/krempner/) studying novel catalytic systems. In my off time, I like to cook and make beer. My primary research interests are at the intersection of optimization and process systems engineering, specifically in the space of model predictive control and real-time optimization. Most of the content of this website is in the blog section. The blog covers a wide array of topics, including implmenting algorithms, data driven methods, optimization and much more.
