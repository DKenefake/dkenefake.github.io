# About
Howdy! I'm Dustin Kenefake and I'm a forth-year chemical engineering PhD student in the Pistikopoulos Lab at Texas A&M. My primary research interests are at the intersection of optimization and process systems engineering, specifically in the space of model predictive control and real-time optimization. Most of the content of this website is in the blog section. The blog covers a wide array of topics, including implmenting algorithms, data driven methods, optimization and much more.

This is based on Hydeout, so much appreciation for the work that went into [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)!
