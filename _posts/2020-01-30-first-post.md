This is my first post on my personal website! Shout out to my friend <a href="https://gibsramen.github.io/">Gibs Rahman<\a>, a PhD student at UC San Diego studying bioinformatics, for showing me how to set up a personal website on GitHub and letting me use his template.

I'm using the [Hydeout](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) template, modified by Gibs
