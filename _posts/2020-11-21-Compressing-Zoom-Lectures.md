I have been recording classes on zoom, and the accumulation of files is starting to become a problem. I have been exploring handbrake used to re-encode the screen grabs to reduce the file size while keeping the quality up. This does require a decent CPU to run in a reasonable amount of time, so keep that in mind.

Here are the encoding settings that I used.

A set of class recordings, including scrolling around a pdf and static power points were used to benchmark the file size reduction. As a sided note, there was no noticeable degradation in video quality. I saw a 5 fold reduction in file size, from 20 GB to 4 GB. This made uploading and sharing videos much quicker and easier.
