I have been recording classes on zoom and the accumulation of files is starting to become a problem. I have been exporing the use of handbreak to re-encode the screen grabs to reduce the file size while keeping the quility up. This does require a decent cpu to run in a reasonable amount of time however so keep that in mind.

Here is the encording settings that I used.

A set of class recordings that include scrolling around a pdf and static power points was used to benchmark the file size reduction. As a sided note, there was no noticable degridation in video quality. I saw a 5 fold reduction in file size, from 20 GB to 4 GB. This made uploading and sharing videos much quicker and easier.
