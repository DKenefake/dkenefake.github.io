The Chebyshev ball is the largest ball that fits inside of a set $\mathcal{Q}$. There is a different definition for this: the smallest ball that contains the set $\mathcal{Q}$. The second definition is fundamentally different from the first definition, and we will only cover the first definition. The first definition is a simple statement that can be written as the following optimization problem. We can read this as "maximize the radius of the ball subject to the ball fitting in $\mathcal{Q}$." 

$$
\begin{equation} \label{}
\begin{split}
\min_{x_c, r} r&\\
 \text{s.t. } \mathcal{B}&(x_c, r) \subset \mathcal{Q}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$$

The above formulation lets us state the problem, but the formulation is not helpful to solve the problem. I will cover the case of $\mathcal{Q}$ being a finite-dimensional polytope. In addition $\mathcal{Q}$ is a set constrained by a finite number of hyperplanes of the following form $a_i \cdot x \leq b$. This is what you would normally think of the polygon. If it we did not have a finite number of hyperplane contraints, then while it would be convex it would not be solvable in the following way (Think of a circle). Mathematically this is expressed as the following set $\mathcal{Q} = \{x\in\mathcal{R}^n: Ax\leq b\}$. Below is an example of a Chebyshev ball of a polytope.

Here I will give a quick sketch of how to reformulate the first optimization problem into a simple linear program for the polytopic region $\mathcal{Q}$. This derivation is found on slide 12 in the references. The first step is separating the center of the ball and the area around the ball.

$$
\begin{equation} \label{}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{B}(x_c, r) \subset \mathcal{Q} & \iff  x_c + u \in \mathcal{Q}, \forall u \in \mathcal{B}(\mathbf{0}, r)  \\
 & \iff a_i^T(x_c+u)\leq b_i, \forall u: ||u||_2 \leq r, i\in\{1, \dots, m\}\\
 & \iff \sup_{\forall u:||u||_2 \leq r} a_i^Tu \leq b_i - a_i^Tx_c, i\in\{1, \dots, m\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$$

Here the statement $ x_c + u \in \mathcal{Q}$ means, everything in the set $u$, which is the ball of radius $r$ centered at zero shifted by the center $x_c$ is inside our polytope. The second line expresses the hyperplane constrains of the polytope, $\mathcal{Q}$. All points $y\in\mathcal{Q}$ must obey the constraints $Ay\leq b$, where there are $m$ hyperplane constraints. Since this ball must be inside the polytope then so must $x_c + u, \forall u : \left \lVert u\right\rVert_2 \leq r,  i\in 1, \dots, m $. The last line is a rearrangement of the previous line. They are then recasting it to find the most extreme point of the set $u$ that would violate the constraint. Instead of needing to look at all points in $u$ we need to know the largest value that it could attain. This reformulation can is completed via the Cauchy-Schwartz Inequality. 

$$a_i^Tu \leq ||a_i||_2||u|| \leq r ||a_i||_2, \forall i = \{1, \dots, m\}$$

We can reformulate this optimization problem from the first one based on balls into the following simple LP. I like writing things in minimization, so I am multiplying the objective by $-1$. 

$$
\begin{equation} \label{}
\begin{split}
\min_{x_c, r} -r&\\
\text{s.t. } a_j^Tx_c& + ||a_i||_2 r \leq b_j, \forall i \in \{1, \dots, m\}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$$

Via similar arguments, we can show that if $\mathcal{Q}$ has equality constraints, it takes the following form. Where $\mathbf{I}$ is the set of equality constraints, $\mathbf{J}$ is the set of inequality constraints of the region $\mathcal{Q}$.

$$
\begin{equation} \label{}
\begin{split}
\min_{x_c, r} -r&\\
\text{s.t. } a_i^Tx_c& \leq b_j, \forall i \in \mathbf{I}\\
a_j^Tx_c& + ||a_j||_2 r \leq b_j, \forall j \in \mathbf{J}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

$$

I have written up this reformulation in Python, and it utilizes my [SimpleDenseGurobi](https://github.com/DKenefake/SimpleDenseGurobi) package. The package allows us to express and then solve the optimization problem quickly. Please play around with the code!
